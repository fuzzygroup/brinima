# The Brinima Theme

This Bridgetown theme is a port of the Jekyll Minima theme to Bridgetown.

## I'll Start with an Apology

I have to admit that I'm a lousy, awful, terrible, no good front end person who, yet, 
finds himself making a theme that is front end in nature.  Minima, when it works on Jekyll, 
is lovely and any errors are really my fault.

### If I'm Lousy at Front End Why Am I Doing a Theme?

I'm doing this because Jekyll has been in life support mode for too damn long and Jared's 
Bridgetown is the closest thing to a decent successor I've seen.  And I need minima for my own
efforts so better to try and do something good than not.
